# Spudwart's AMP Templates
These are custom templates I have made to use.

# Making generic module templates
This is more for my own reference than anything, but if it's helpful for you, please read on.

This a much more robust version of the [online configuration tool](https://iceofwraith.github.io/GenericConfigGen/) that, while in beta, has proven to be way better than the official version. If you have any feedback, please contact IceOfWraith in the CubeCoders Discord.

See the wiki article for the module: https://github.com/CubeCoders/AMP/wiki/Configuring-the-'Generic'-AMP-module

# This is a closed template repository!
Please do not send me templates to upload, I will not upload them. If you wish to use whatever is here in your own with these, feel free to fork!
